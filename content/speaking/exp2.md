I am thrilled to share that I recently completed a short-term, hands-on course in Machine Learning for Biomedical Signal Processing from ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management. This course enabled me to learn advanced techniques and practical applications of machine learning in the field of biomedical signal processing.

Thank you, Dr. Irshad Ahmad Ansari Sir, for organizing such informative sessions. I am eager to apply these techniques in my academic pursuits and beyond.
